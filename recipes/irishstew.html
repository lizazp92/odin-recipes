        <li>1 tablespoon butter;</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour;</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock;</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary;</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped;</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, chopped;</li>
        <li>water as needed;</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season lamb shoulder chops with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat. Working in batches, cook lamb shoulder chops until browned on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a stock pot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in the same skillet over medium heat until slightly softened and edges are browning, about 5 minutes. Stir butter into onion until melted; add flour and stir until onions are coated, about 1 minute.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour stock into onion mixture; bring to a boil, add rosemary, and stir until mixture thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir carrots and celery into pot with lamb shoulder chops and pour chicken stock mixture over the top. Add water as needed to cover meat completely. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and cook until meat is almost falling off the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer meat to a plate. Stir potatoes into stew and return meat to stew, placing on top of vegetables. Simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender and meat is falling off the bone, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer meat to a plate using a slotted spoon. Bring stew to a boil and cook, skimming off fat, until stew is reduced and thick, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove meat from bones; discard bones and any pieces of fat. Stir meat back into stew. Stir green onions into stew and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
